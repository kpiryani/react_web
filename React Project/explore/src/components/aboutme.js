      I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cognitive Science at North Carolina State University. 
      As both a dedicated individual and a collaborative team player, I am excited to positively contribute to the rapidly 
      evolving field of neurotechnology. I am particularly passionate about the ethical implications of AI and investigating
       its role in advancing neuromorphic computing to create systems that mimic human intelligence and adaptability.
